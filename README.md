# Patient Record Management System on Blockchain

This project is a decentralized patient record management system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for secure storage and retrieval of patient data, ensuring privacy, integrity, and accessibility.

## Features

- **Secure Data Storage**: Patient records are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring immutability and security.
- **Decentralized Access Control**: Only authorized users can access patient data, controlled through smart contracts.
- **Audit Trail**: Every interaction with patient records is recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and tamper-proof audit trail.
- **Frontend Interface**: Intuitive frontend interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy interaction with the system.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: Smart contracts are written in Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Truffle**: Development framework for Ethereum that simplifies the process of building, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- **Ganache**: Local blockchain server for development and testing purposes.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend web technologies for building the user interface.
